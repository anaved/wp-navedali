 	<li>Market prices of bonds are expressed in terms of yields, which make the bond called expensive or cheap.</li>
 	<li>Yield has an inverse relation to bond price. A person who got a bond on discount e.g 80 for 100 par will get yield of 20, in oppose to person who got in premium 101 where yield is -1 )</li>

&nbsp;If a bond is bought at par value and held to maturity, then the return is equal to the coupon rate.&nbsp;

If a bond is bought at a discount and held to maturity, then the return will be higher than the coupon rate.&nbsp;

If a bond is bought at a premium and held to maturity, then the return will be lower than the coupon rate.&nbsp;In the case of a zero-coupon bond that repays at par, the return will be determined solely by the discount.
