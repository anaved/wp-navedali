Dirty Price:
Dirty Price = Clean Price + Accrued Interest ( till the date of exchange at the rate of coupon)[Here day count convention comes into picture]
Is is calculated on settlement date of day of purchase? (T+2,T+3 etc)
n the United States, it is the market convention to quote a bond in terms of its clean price; in other markets, bonds are more commonly quoted in terms of their dirty price.
