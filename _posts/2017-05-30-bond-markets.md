Even though bond market is a common jargon, in reality there is no singular place or exchange where bonds are traded. In-fact, the bond market is a huge OTC ( Over the Counter ) market,  consisting independent dealers, organised by types of securities. Most bonds are sold dealer to dealer, which is also called a secondary market.
