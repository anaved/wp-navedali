Python Data Analysis Library or Pandas is derived from the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)">Panel Data</a>. Pandas is a BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. It provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.

<strong>Pandas is well suited for different kinds of data, such as:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Labeled and relational data. Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet.</li>
	<li>Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data. Works well even with rough and unlabeled data.</li>
	<li>Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels.</li>
	<li>Any other form of observational / statistical data sets.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Salient features of Pandas library:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different file formats such as flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format.</li>
	<li>DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.</li>
	<li>Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data.</li>
	<li>Filtering, reshaping and pivoting of data sets.</li>
	<li>Label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and sub-setting of large data sets.</li>
	<li>Columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects.</li>
	<li>Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.</li>
	<li>Data set merging and joining.</li>
	<li>Hierarchical axis indexing to work with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure.</li>
	<li>Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.</li>
	<li>Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)</li>
</ul>
Pandas is highly optimized for performance, with critical code paths written in Cython or C.
