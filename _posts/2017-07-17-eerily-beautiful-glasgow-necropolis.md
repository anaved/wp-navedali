Though not a journey after being in Glasgow for about a month. This was still one ways where I always wanted to take Misbah along, but could never due to something or the other.

Finally this weekend after being under the weather all night, I lost my senses and drag her along for a stroll to Glasgow Necropolis instead of rains.

Luckily sun god showed mercy on us when we reach there. Sadly we missed the chance to visit the Central Cathedral due to reaching there after 5 PM., so that's for next time.
