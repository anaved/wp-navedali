 	<li>Investment funds such as mutual funds, money market funds, and ETFs</li>
 	<li>Pension funds</li>
 	<li>Insurance companies</li>
 	<li>Banks</li>
 	<li>Hedge funds</li>
 	<li>Monetary authorities (central banks)</li>
 	<li>State and local governments</li>

Individual users can opt to buy bonds directly from some market, but mostly investors do so via Bond Funds.
