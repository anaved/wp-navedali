Offshore currencies are employed by countries to enable forex trading of their currencies,  keeping control over the capital flow through its geographical boundaries at the same time.  In some cases there are foreign exchange or banking regulations which require onshore capital controls, hence the same currency is traded offshore with different regulatory regime.
<h2>Eurodollar:</h2>
Eurodollars are the deposits in US dollars at banks outside the United States, hence not under the Fed's jurisdiction.  Liquidity on Eurodollar is not guaranteed by Federal Reserve, thus making them riskier. Due to this Eurodollars can have higher interest rate.

Taking China as an example, its offshore currency CNH was introduced as a way to internationalise CNY, the onshore currency without opening up China's capital account.
