&nbsp;If a bond is bought at par value and held to maturity, then the return is equal to the coupon rate.&nbsp;

If a bond is bought at a discount and held to maturity, then the return will be higher than the coupon rate.&nbsp;

If a bond is bought at a premium and held to maturity, then the return will be lower than the coupon rate.&nbsp;In the case of a zero-coupon bond that repays at par, the return will be determined solely by the discount.
