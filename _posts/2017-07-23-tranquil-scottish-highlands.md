No two journeys are ever same. However few are bit more special, both in magnitude as well as expectations. Our first trip to Highlands certainly fell into this category. I spent weeks planning for this one, from accommodation, to list of places, to routes, to activities, even the vehicle.
We started on Saturday with Inverness being our first stop. Although we missed our chance to spot dolphins, we did come across some serene places. Next stop was Loch Ness. After a customary lake cruise we moved towards Port Appin for our stay at Airds.
